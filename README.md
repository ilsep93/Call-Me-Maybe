# Call Me Maybe: Noncoverage error in Mexican cell-phone surveys

My masters' thesis from the Survey Methodology program at the University of Michigan

## Abstract

This study examines non-coverage bias associated with using a cell-phone mode of data collection compared to a face-to-face interview. A random sample of 2010 census records for the Mexican states of Jalisco and Puebla are treated as the true population value, while households that indicated that at least one member of their household owned a cell-phone are used as a subset that could have been contacted using a cell-phone mode of data collection. The difference between census records and the cell-phone subset is calculated for 50 survey variables to estimate noncoverage bias. After using ratio-raking adjustments, five survey estimates still have an absolute bias that is greater than five percentage points: owning a refrigerator, owning a washing machine, owning a car or van, having drainage inside the household property, and having access to all three available public services (electricity, drainage, and piped water).
