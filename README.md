Working Title: "Call Me Maybe: Noncoverage error in Mexican cell-phone surveys"

This author could find no studies that have sought to quantify noncoverage bias associated with switching from a face-to-face to a cell-phone mode of data collection in developing countries. In other words, there is a gap in the literature that explores how groups of the population may be systematically excluded from a cell-phone survey, and how not having these units affects survey estimates.  Studies of noncoverage bias in developed countries show that survey estimates may be biased if there is a strong correlation between households that have a telephone and the survey estimates of interest (Blumberg et al 2016; Lee et al. 2010; Link et al. 2007). A similar study in developing countries can help practitioners make informed decisions about the tradeoffs between cost and bias for various data collection methods.

This study attempts to fill this gap by examining noncoverage bias in Mexico. Stay tuned for results and discussion!
